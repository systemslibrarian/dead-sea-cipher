export const FULL_ARC_REFLECTION = `From a prophet encoding the name of an empire in sacred text, to an emperor shifting letters by three, to a "perfect" cipher broken after 300 years of false confidence, to a mathematically perfect system impossible to deploy, to an algorithm that carries every lesson forward — the arc of cryptography is a story of human ingenuity confronting its own limitations.

Each cipher failed. Each failure taught something irreplaceable. And each successor was built on the wreckage of what came before.

AES-256-GCM doesn't exist in isolation. It is the living summary of 2,600 years of cryptographic history — from Jeremiah's Atbash to Shannon's proof to NIST's selection process. Every design decision in modern cryptography carries the DNA of every cipher that fell before it.`;
